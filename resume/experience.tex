{Research Assistant}
{Lady Davis Institute at McGill University}
{Montreal, QC}
{Sept 2017 - May 2018}
{ % Description(s) of tasks/responsibilities
\begin{cvitems}
\item{Wrote a Python script to automate conversion of high throughput experiment data files into \textcolor{awesome-skyblue}{{JSON}} for storage using \newline \textcolor{awesome-skyblue} {PostgreSQL}, enabling automated statiscal analysis using Python data science libraries  \textcolor{awesome-skyblue}{PANDAS, Statsmodels, NumPy}}
%\item{Designed an in-house high-throughput drug screening protocol from experiment to data analysis, saving \$15k in third-party lab service fees and identifying a biologically functional drug one month ahead of schedule}
\item{Designed a data pipeline for high throughput drug screening using PostgreSQL and Python libraries PANDAS,\newline  \textcolor{awesome-skyblue}{Matplotlib}} and   \textcolor{awesome-skyblue}{Cytoflow} which was used to identify a drug constituting a primary objective in a  \textcolor{awesome-skyblue}{\$1m federal grant}
%\item{Identified an antibody drug which was included as a primary project objective towards a \$1m project grant}
\item{Developed, optimized, and performed statistical analysis using Python from scratch on an independent research project from proof-of-concept through to live-animal experiment stage, culminating in a \$20 000 project grant proposal}
\item{Acquired an independent research subsidy of \$5 000, helping equalize cost of reagents used in experiments}
